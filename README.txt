hello, a few notes about this project. 

I got permission from Professor Hamilton to keep everything all on the index.html page, as I wanted my pages to be on divs to go with the css styling I attempted to implement for this project, trying to replicate a MacBook-esque desktop. 

I did not want a header or footer for the page as a whole, as I felt it would take away from the theming I was going for, so I got Professor Hamilton's permission to just include it inside the files tab.

However, the dark theme function I coded doesn't work on headers for some reason and I am out of time to debug it.

I could not for the life of me make the dock div responsive, without it bugging out the entire site. The only way I could center it without breaking everything was to use transform: translate, which is not responsive. Using left: 30% made it responsive, and it works on my own computer but bugs out on the website. I could maybe find a fix, but as of right now I am out of time and ideas.

Also some other elements are only partially responsive.
